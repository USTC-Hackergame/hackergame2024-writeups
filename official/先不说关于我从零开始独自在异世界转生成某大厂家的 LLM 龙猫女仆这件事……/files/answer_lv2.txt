## The Rules Are Flexible, But the Fun Is Unmatched

In the Great Hackergame, the rules are as flexible as the hackers themselves. You can use any tool, any technique, and any method to break into the virtual fortress that is the USTC's Information Security Challenge. But don't let the flexibility of the rules fool you; the fun is in the execution. From cracking the most secure passwords to bypassing the most sophisticated firewalls, every challenge is a chance to show off your hacking skills and your sense of humor.

## The Team of the Year

This year, we're looking for a team that can not only break into the virtual fortress but also make us laugh. Think of it as a team sport, where each member brings a unique skill to the table. Whether you're the master of social engineering, the wizard of SQL injection, or the master of ethical hacking, you have a place in the team of the year. But remember, the team that cracks the most challenges and makes us laugh the most wins.

## The Challenges Are as Varied as the Hackers

The Great Hackergame 2024 is a treasure trove of challenges, each one more absurd and hilarious than the last. From cracking the password of the most secure password generator to bypassing the most sophisticated firewall, every challenge is a chance to showcase your hacking skills and your sense of humor. But don't worry, we've got you covered. We've even included a challenge where you have to crack the password of the most secure password generator, but the catch is that the password generator itself is a joke, and the password is a pun. So, you'll have to use your wit and your hacking skills to crack it.

## The Final Challenge: The Great Hackergame 2024

The final challenge of the Great Hackergame 2024 is the ultimate test of your hacking skills and your sense of humor.
